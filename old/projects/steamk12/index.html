        <h5>MAKING POSTCARDS FROM SPACE WITH PAPER CIRCUITS @ INTERPLANETARY 2019</h5>
        <p>
            Hosted a STEAM booth at the Santa Fe Institute's second annual <a href="https://interplanetaryfest.org/" target="_blank">Interplanetary Festival</a>.
            Our booth let kids and their families design "postcards from space" where they would imagine that they are space travelers writing postcards to their
            friends and families back home on Earth. We provided postcards, art supplies, and paper circuit supplies like copper tape, coin cell batteries, and LEDs.
            We guided visitors how to make their first paper circuits to light up an LED and let them choose how to creatively integrate it into their postcards.
