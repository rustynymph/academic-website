          <p>
            Hello there, I'm a PhD student in the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder,
            where I also earned my B.S. in Computer Science and a certificate in Technology, Arts, and Media. 
            I'm a member of the 
            <a href="https://playfulcomputation.group">Laboratory for Playful Computation</a> 
            where I'm known as the resident "code witch." My advisor is <a href="http://benshapi.ro">Dr. Ben Shapiro</a>.
            <br><br>
            
            My research focuses on ways that we can empower adult women artists
            to learn to engineer their own technologies for live performance. I use 
            design research and feminist methodologies to achieve this – by looking at how
            artists learn to work with interactive technologies, focusing on what artistic and computational practices they employ, and 
            understanding what typical challenges they encounter in order to design better programmable technologies 
            and curricula. I do this by teaching artist workshops, hosting 
            hackathon-style events, and collaborating with artists to help them learn to engineer their own technologies 
            to achieve their creative visions. This is all part of  
            the <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#artist-workshops"><i>Weird Code Club</i></a>. 
            I am a computer scientist by training, and a musician by heart – in both domains it is 
            common for women to be underrepresented as technicians and engineers. In particular, in the 
            performing arts, the artists themselves have to contract or outsource much of the technical 
            requirements of their projects to other people. In some situations this can be ideal, but in others it
            can result in artists having to to relinquish a lot of their own creative control. This is 
            an issue that I am passionate about addressing, and currently exploring in my work.
            <br><br>
            In addition to my research, I am usually working on several artistic endeavors at a time which include interactive
            and immersive installations and playing in loud obnoxious rock bands.

          <h2 class="mb-5">Weird Code Club</h2>
          Part of what I'm passionate about is empowering adult artists to engineer their own technologies for live applications – like performing arts, interactive museum exhibits, and more. 
          Typically, when artists want to incorporate custom interactive technology into their 
          performances, they have to outsource the work to engineers, losing creative agency in the process. 
          The Weird Code Club is a series of educational workshops and computational tools designed to empower artists 
          to have more control over the designs of technologies used in their projects, and to help them 
          become more self-confident creative technologists.
          <br><br>
          Some of the performance technologies the Weird Code Club seeks to make more accessible are: toolkits to simplify the construction of real-time 
          tangible interfaces, design tools that target specific creation goals like stage lighting, proximity detection, VJ and visual performance 
          software, and audio processing tools.<br><br>

              We recently worked with students enrolled in a graduate CU dance course called <i>Advanced Composition</i>. We led a few days of instruction for how to use a beginner-friendly 
              physical computing tools to create interactive systems and then let the students choose a final project to work on. Students were specifically taught how to use the micro:bit 
              as well as how to create their own physical inputs using electronics and craft materials, and also how to map input from real-time sensors to output such as sound, lighting, and motion.
              Students met with me one-on-one for technical advice but 
              were instructed to build their systems themselves, which including both the programming and construction. Students then performed using their technologies that they built.

              We have also started running a series of interactive stage-lighting courses for artists and musicians. Using physical computing tools and browser-based programming editors
              we teach musicians how to build physical interfaces that can be used in real-time to control professional stage lighting equipment. Participating artists are taught how to control DMX512 stage
              lighting equipment using custom-built physical inputs and sensors.<br>

              <h3 class="mb-0">"The Cell"</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">An immersive and interactive scientific installation of an E.Coli cell</div>
              <p>
              <img src="./img/dna.gif" width="150" align="right">
              The Cell is an immersive, interactive, room-sized installation of an E.Coli cell housed in the University of Colorado Boulder’s ATLAS Institute. 
              The inspiration for this project was to make a fun, visually engaging, and explorative educational experience. Upon entering the room, visitors are stepping inside of an E-coli cell and can touch, play, and interact with the different elements of the cell. 
              The Cell contains large strands of interactive DNA that you can “unzip” by separating nucleotide pairs. 
              As visitors separate the nucleotide pairs, the bases of the pair – A, G, C, and T – are revealed and denoted by color. 
              Visitors can also pick up pieces of RNA off the floor and attach it to the strands of DNA to create different 
              RNA sequences. Eventually, visitors will be able to use these RNA sequences to activate proteins and then place the proteins in the cell’s receptors to 
              change the behavior and appearance of the cell. The construction of this project involved carpentry, scultpure, laser cutting, programming 
              physical computing technologies to add interactivity, sound design, and more.<br>

              <h3 class="mb-0">"The Show"</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">A dance performance featuring interactive light-up costumes</div>
              <p>
                <img src="./img/theshow.gif" width="180" align="right">
                “The Show” was a 2018 dance performance produced and choreographed by CU alumnus Emily Daub. 
                The performance was about exploring relationships between people and different genres of dance. 
                I designed and developed the software for the interactive light-up costumes. Each costume had between 1-5 
                proximity sensors embedded into the clothing to sense the distances between each dancer at any given time. 
                Each costume had a default color (e.g. one dancer was red, one was blue, etc) and the colors of each dancer 
                would affect the colors of the LEDs of the dancers around them. For example, if the blue dancer and red dancer 
                were close in proximity, both of their costumes' LEDs would blend and light up purple, and when they moved away from each other 
                the lights would start to fade closer to their default colors. The LEDs on some of the costumes were also programmed to 
                display different kinds of animations based on the rotational speed of the dancer. I also implemented a remote control 
                device that I could use during the performance to remotely switch the costumes between different settings. </p>

              <p>DoggyVsion is an augmented reality mobile application I developed that lets people see the world in a dog’s color spectrum. It is a common 
                misconception that dogs can only see the world in monochromatic black and white, in actuality dogs' vision is dichomatic. DoggyVision was 
                developed in Unity for iOS and Android and can be used in handheld mode and also with a Google Cardboard.

              <div class="subheading mb-3">A programmable toolkit for building collaborative musical controllers</div>
              <p>
                  BlockyTalky is a programming environment designed to make it easy for novice programmers to 
                  make interactive, networked physical computing devices. Kids as young as ten have used it 
                  to rapidly build a wide range of projects, from networked cat feeders to computer music systems. 
                  Part of my work on this project was to adapt BlockyTalky so that it could be used by adults to 
                  interface with professional level artistic software like Max/MSP, Pd, Unity, Processing, and more.<br>

              <div class="subheading mb-3">An augmented reality toolkit for prototyping live artistic controllers</div>
              <p>
                  ARcadia is a toolkit for bringing paper prototypes to life through the use of marker-based Augmented Reality. 
                  It enables people to create tangible interfaces for real-time creative expression without the use of 
                  embedded sensors or electronics.

                  Users can construct interfaces using cardboard, paper, and other craft materials and stick fiducial markers on it to enable tracking via a webcam. 
                  Users can then program different mappings between markers and events to add interactivity to their projects. After the crafting and programming phase, a user can play with their interface live – meaning their interactions with the interface will cause events to occur in real-time.
                  
                  Examples of possible projects include drum machines, pianos, games, etc with only using cardboard, fiducial markers, and a camera.<br>

                "when I'm concentrating, speed up Earth's orbit," or "when I'm reading, fly to the Kuiper belt." This is made possible through the use of several 
                customizable machine learning algorithms that allow users to customize the experience based on their own brain's activity and to 
                set up the controls that they want to play with. <a href="http://sciss.se/uniview">Uniview</a> is a very popular 
                option for planetariums across the world, so we designed our application to interface with it in order to provide a high-quality visual
                experience, and also make our application ubiquitous enough to be used in most institutions.<br>

              <p>
                  Audiovisual Playground is a 3D, virtual, music-making interface developed in Unity for the HTC 
                  VIVE virtual reality headset. We took the idea of the popular musical composition tool, 
                  music sequencer, and transformed it from a 2D linear interface to a 3D circular one that 
                  users can interact with and walk around.

              <p>Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art's <i>Cultural Cul-de-sac</i> was a series of events designed to bring members of the Boulder community together
              and engage in discussions about different cultures. Several animations of mine were displayed during the cul-de-sac event,

              <div class="subheading mb-3">A temporary museum installation about the lifecycle of butterflies</div>
              <p>
                  <img src="./img/metamorphosis.png" width="180" align="right">
                  Working with the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, we designed and 
                  implemented Metamorphosis, a system for an engaging, educational butterfly exhibit called <i>Becoming Butterflies</i>. 
                  The exhibit employs augmented reality and full-body interaction to guide users through 
                  critical phases of a butterfly‘s metamorphosis process.  
                  Metamorphosis lets children experience this life cycle with their own bodies by interacting with an 
                  animated projected character. Children begin the interaction by standing in front of the exhibit 
                  where they can be tracked by the Kinect. Once the Kinect begins tracking, the child is prompted (via text projected on the wall 
                  and audio played via overhead speak- ers) to crouch to become an egg. Once the child crouches, the projector displays
                  an egg. The user wiggles back and forth to break free of the egg and become a caterpillar. In caterpillar form, 
                  the user moves around eating leaves by making a “chomping" gesture with his/her arms until the caterpillar is ready to 
                  become a chrysalis. At this point the user reaches his/her hand up to touch the branch overhead, 
                  forming a silk thread and becoming a chrysalis. The child holds still until the exhibit prompts them to break 
                  free and become a butterfly by reaching their arms out. Finally, the child is prompted to move his/her arms up 
                  and down to fly away and lay another egg.

                on how people learn and play with cutting-edge advances in programmable digital media. In 
                addition, I currently lead my own research projects around building DIY and programmable 
                tools for live artistic performance.
