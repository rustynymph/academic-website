                <p>
                I recently worked with students enrolled in a graduate CU dance course called <i>Advanced Composition</i>. We led a few days of instruction for how to use a beginner-friendly 
                physical computing tools to create interactive systems and then let the students choose a final project to work on. Students were specifically taught how to use the micro:bit 
                as well as how to create their own physical inputs using electronics and craft materials, and also how to map input from real-time sensors to output such as sound, lighting, and motion.
                Students met with me one-on-one for technical advice but 
                were instructed to build their systems themselves, which including both the programming and construction. Students then performed using their technologies that they built.

                <p>
                We have also started running a series of interactive stage-lighting courses for artists and musicians. Using physical computing tools and browser-based programming editors
                we teach musicians how to build physical interfaces that can be used in real-time to control professional stage lighting equipment. Participating artists are taught how to control DMX512 stage
                lighting equipment using custom-built physical inputs and sensors.

                <p>
                The Talking Trees Jam was a weekend workshop where participants collaborated on interactive art installations that embody Colorado environmental data. Participants worked with real scientific data collected in Colorado forests and physical computing tools to bring their installations to life.
